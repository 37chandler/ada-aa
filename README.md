# ADA-AA: Association Analysis Project

This repository contains resources and examples for conducting **Association Rule Mining** as part of the **ADA (Advanced Data Analytics)** course. The focus is on exploring transaction data and discovering patterns using frequent itemset and rule generation techniques.

## Folder Contents

- **`dram-example.ipynb`**  
  An example notebook that demonstrates how to apply association rule mining to transactional data from The Dram Shop. This notebook provides a complete walkthrough, including data preprocessing, frequent itemset mining, and rule generation using the `mlxtend` library.

- **`wedge-assignment.ipynb`**  
  A (barely started) notebook for you  to explore association rule mining on the **Wedge Grocery Store** dataset. 

- **`README.md`**  
  This file, providing an overview of the repository structure and purpose.

## How to Use

1. **For Learning**:  
   Start with `dram-example.ipynb` to understand the methodology and implementation of association analysis.

2. **For Assignment**:  
   Open `wedge-assignment.ipynb` to work through the Wedge Grocery Store dataset. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the analysis.

3. **Technical Requirements**:  
   Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `mlxtend`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn` (optional for advanced visualizations)

4. **Environment Setup**:  
   Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code with Python extensions) to run the `.ipynb` files.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply **association rule mining** to real-world datasets.
- Explore customer purchasing patterns and generate actionable insights.
- Use the **Apriori algorithm** and interpret metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
